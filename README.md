## Learning Objectives

- The students should be able to understand the fundamental differences between GraphQL and REST APIs and articulate the benefits of using GraphQL over REST for specific use cases.
- The students should be able to describe the key concepts of GraphQL, including queries, and mutations.
- The students should be able to differentiate between various GraphQL types (scalar, object, enum) and fields.

### Intro to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, designed to give clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs.

Remeber REST apis rely on hitting endpoints with pre-built queries. Where as GraphQL queries can be customized on the fly.

## Key Benefits of GraphQL

1. **Efficiency:** With GraphQL, each client can request precisely what they need, reducing over-fetching of data. 

2. **Flexibility:** GraphQL lets clients define their data requirements, avoiding the need for multiple endpoints catering to different needs. 

3. **Real-time Updates:** GraphQL supports real-time data updates with subscriptions. This means clients can receive instant updates when new data becomes available, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

## Basics of GraphQL Queries and Mutations

### **Queries: Ordering Your Data**

In a bakery, making a query is like placing an order for your favorite pastry. You specify what you want â€“ the type, flavor, and any additional toppings. For example,

```graphql
# (graphql syntax)
query { #submitting a query
    #querying a using, name to filter
  pastry(name: "chocolate croissant") { 
    name #These are the fields we want returned to us. (name,price, ingredients)
    price
    flavor
  }
  customer(email: String){
    phone
    name
  }
  order(id: ID){
    date
  }
}
```
### Mutations: Creating and Updating data

```graphql
# (graphql syntax)
mutation { #creating a mutation
    #adding pastry Object with the following fields
  addPastry(name: "Blueberry Muffin", flavor: "blueberry", price: 2.50) {
    name    #once created the following fields are returned
    price
  }
  addCustomer(name: String, id: ID, phone: String, email: String, password: String ){
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Types

Types in GraphQL are a combination of predefined datatypes, aswell as types you define yourself as a Type Object. The types are used to define the structure of your data, and API capabilities.


- Scalar Types: Are your basic units of data, Strings Ints, Booleans, IDs, Floats

```graphQL
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int
  height: Float
  isActive: Boolean
}
```
- Objects Types: Object types are similar to python dictionaries, and represent complex objects with multiple fields

```graphQL
type User {
  id: ID! #exclamation points indicate that a field cannot be null
  name: String!
  age: Int
}

type Position {
  position_name: String
  salary: Float
  employee: User #Object Type
}

type Query {
  user: User #user field is of type User
}
```

- Query Types: Special type that defines what can be queried from the data base

```graphQL
type Query {
  users: [User]
  user(id: ID!): User #When quering a single userm you need to pass in an id 
  posts: [Post]
  post(id: ID!): Post
  positions: [Postion]
  postion(positon_name: String!): Postions
}

query {
  users {
    name
  } #Returns a list of users, but only their name included
}
```
- Mutation Type: Special type that defines what information can be added

```graphQL
type Mutation {
  addBook(title: String!, author: String!): Book!
  addUser(id: ID!, name: String!, age: Int): User! #function to create a user, and returns a User object which is required
}
```

### Fields

Fields are the catagories that make up types, often time you will refer to the fields according to what type the field is associated with. fields also serve as your "endpoints" when querying
